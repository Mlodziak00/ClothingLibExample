The repository contains example assets and data for:
- Slim and Base skin types
- Item Model and Texture
- Lang Files
- Adding the Item into an ItemTag (so it can show on the player)
- Adding the Item into Trinkets Slot (so it can be put into the slot)

Also contains code for adding a new ClothingItem inside ItemInit
